This file contains the official grammar / language spec for the Portable Programming Language.

The .c files within the PPL dir/ are ad-hoc examples to showcase various use-cases
of the language.

The goal of PPL is to support C99 spec and C++ spec "out of the box".
Along with other compile-time languages as well.

Compile-time interop of various languages is the core idea to support targeting any platform
and building any type of program.

Note that PPL is a core citizen of the set of languages to interop with.
(because PPL deviates from C/C++).
