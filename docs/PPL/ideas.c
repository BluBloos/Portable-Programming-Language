/*
The answer should be, "what is the natural way that you would type it".
and this is derived from the order of thought.

When you are writing code, and you think about "I want to make a variable of type
integer with a name of A".
Hence,
int A;
Over,
A: int;

// One idea is the following : could create an IDE that virtualizes the syntax into your
// preferred style. According to how you formulate sentences in your head.
// give user a quiz when they first begin the IDE. A series of short questions where they say,
// "I prefer this over that".

// #idea, what if also we could identify a variable to a location on some IO module
// that is not memory mapped?
// or a location on the disk drive?
//
// this idea _may_ be much too high-level ...
// but interesting nonetheless :D
