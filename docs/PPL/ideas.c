/*
When you are writing code, and you think about "I want to make a variable of
type integer with a name of A". Hence, int A; Over, A: int;

At least, if you are a C porgrammer you would think this!

// One idea is the following : could create an IDE that virtualizes the syntax
// into your preferred style. Preferred style = how you formulate sentences in
// your head. Give user a quiz when they first begin the IDE. A series of short
// questions where they say, "I prefer this over that".

// #idea, what if also we could identify a variable to a location that is not
// stack or heap? this idea _may_ be much too high-level ... but interesting
// nonetheless :D
