                This is a collection of files for the Portable Programming Language (PPL).
                The language is currently being designed.
                These are working examples that take the form of annotated .c/cpp source.
                This is not to say that PPL is .c/cpp, just that the syntax highlighting is
                basically the same.
            </p>
