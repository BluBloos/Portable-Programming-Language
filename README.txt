Portable Programming Language
=============================

Built with <3, this package contains the official compiler toolchain for the
Portable Programming Language.

PPL is a systems programming language with the goal of allowing the developer
to produce software, hassle-free, for any target platform.

This language takes inspiration from many other programming languages. To list
them all would be much too exhaustive. Notable mentions would be C/C++, Jai,
and Odin.

Nota Bene
=========

This project is in HEAVY DEVELOPMENT.

The language is undergoing active design. The design currently leads while the
compiler support lags behind.

Steps for Using
===============

This package contains an interactive program to guide the user through
performing any action that the PPL compiler toolchain currently supports.

macOS
=====

Simply execute the `ppl` binary.

Windows
=======

Double-click on RUN.bat from the File Explorer.

Dependencies
