Need a language that is a superset to C.

Targets:
- Unity
- Unreal Engine
- Writing code for the web
- IOS App
- Android App
- Apple Watch
- Garmin Watches
- Operating Systems
    Windows, macOS, Linux
- Writing code for the Cloud
- Augmented Reality Experiences (OpenXR?)
- Writing code to run on Graphics Cards
- Binary, and for different architectures (for making Operating Systems)
- Arduino

Things to include in Standard Library:
- Blockchain
- Distributed Compute
- Bluetooth
- Wifi

PPL should also be able to insert code for running Javascript as well as Python interpreters.
Just be able to write these languages inline.
I also believe that it would be very nice to write assembly inline.
Maybe even support Go? I have never used Go...

There should exist a custom language server and appropriate Visual Studio Code extensions for this language.

Language should have a good profiler, a good debugger, and a good editor.
When we think about a good editor, we think about virtual whitespace + DEXTER copilot.

Potentially a drag and drop interface for creating GUIs.

Novel Target Platform:
- Custom web server
    - Serves and receives novel content models
        - Stream Video, Audio, User Input. Augmented reality experiences.
        - Think "Writing a program and sharing it in seconds"
            - Like, all other targets are transimissble...?
- Custom web client

Finally, think about device schronicity. Like the kind of ecosystem that Apple has, but we make this extremely cross-device.

When you include something from the standard library
