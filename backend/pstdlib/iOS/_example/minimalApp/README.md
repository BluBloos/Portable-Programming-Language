Following along with https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/about_app_development_with_uikit?language=objc

Every app needs an app icon as well as a launch screen storyboard.

Apps follow the Model-View-Controller (MVC) structure.

There exists the Model objects that represent data, there are view objects
that display on the screen. And there are controller objects that bridge the two.

Controller objects are:
- App Delegate
- View Controller
- UIApplication object

# TODO

- Make the app take up the entire screen.
- Add a launch screen.
- Build out more of the app and continue to understand precisely how UIKit does its magic.
