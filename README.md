The offical repo for the portable programming language. Built with ❤️

## How to Use

There are two files of importance:
- src/ppl.py
- src/tests.py

Running tests.py will run the appropriate tests according to the TEST variable in the script. ppl.py will run the full compiler suite according to the IN_FILE variable in the script. 

These scripts can be run by leveraging https://code.visualstudio.com/ Visual Studio Code. Simply use the Python configuration to run the current file. Alternatively, one can manually set the working directory to the base repo when running the Python scripts.
