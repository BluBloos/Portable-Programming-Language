this morning I was going to get started on the tests to ensure that the parse
pass is good and can proper construct the AST from the tokens. then, I looked at
the codebase and was like, "god, this could be more hygienic". so, code hygiene
it is!

I'm renaming files to indicate more truthfully what they contain. so, instead of
.h, many of the files are actually .cpp, since they contain global scope
functions. there's some dead code chilling around too, so I'm just going to
delete that. and, I'm renaming build.cpp to compiler.cpp, because that's how we
are using this file.
